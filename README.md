## Overview of Analysis

This analysis is to examine the weather of Hawaii from the given data in SQLite data format. The analysis will aid the entrepreneurial decision of Mr. W. Avy. In this analysis, we primarly investigated the standard statistical attributions of the temperature data of Hawaii in the month of June and December.



## Results

- June temperature (n=1700, mean=74.94, s.d.=3.26) has more observation than of December (n=1517, mean=71.04, s.d.=3.75).
- December is 3.9 degree cooler in average compared to June weather. Unsurprisingly, both maximum and minimum temperature observed in December were lower than that in June.
- Temperature in December has larger stander deviation compared to that in June, suggesting a comparatively larger fluctuation of the temperature in December.



## Summary

- As we can see from additional analysis, the temperature in June is more uniform than in December, where majority of the observation is in 70 and other observation fall above and below it.
- As we can see, both June and December observations have suggested that there were unlikely temperatures. For June, that's $\le$​65 and $\ge80$​; for December, that is $\le65$​ and $>75$​​​​. The observation of these temperatures are comparative little.
- Precipitation in both month are both low, but June is comparatively smaller mean precipitation scores than in December.
- In summary, June is warmer than December, and the temperature fluctuate less. June is also drier than December, although both month experience mostly 0 precipitation.
